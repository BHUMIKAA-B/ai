step1: in continuation to task1 to get the statistical summary that is to get the numerical overview of the data to understand its spread,central tendency, and scale.
in this step we get mean,standard deviation, smallest and larget values, 25%,50%,75% quartiles and count
step2: to visualize the numerical features i made use of histograms. here we visualize how data is distributed that is whether it is normal, skewed, or multimodal.
step3: to visualize median, quartiles, and outliers i made use of box plot. here i used seaaborn package.
step4: to see how features relate to each other and to the target.correlation matrix shows numeric strength of relationships between variables, from 1 to -1.pairplot plots pairwise scatterplots and histograms.
step5: identify patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data this helps to find insights that describe how and why survival varied.
