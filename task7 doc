Step1:Import Libraries
Import SVC, GridSearchCV, cross_val_score, metrics, and plotting libraries.
Step2:Use Preprocessed Data
Continue with X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, X_final, y_final from previous tasks.
Step3:Train Linear SVM
Create SVC(kernel='linear').
Fit on training data.
Predict on test set.
Step4: Evaluate Linear SVM
Compute accuracy and classification report.
Plot confusion matrix.
Step 5:Train RBF (Non-Linear) SVM
Create SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1, gamma='scale').
Fit on training data.
Predict on test set.
Step6: Evaluate RBF SVM
Compute accuracy and classification report.
Plot confusion matrix.
Step 7: Compare Linear vs RBF
Print both accuracies to see which performs better.
Step8:Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search)
Define parameter grid for C and gamma.
Run GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation.
Obtain best_params_ and best_estimator_.
Step 9:Evaluate Best Model
Predict on test data with the optimized SVM.
Measure final accuracy.
Step 10:Cross-Validation Check
Run cross_val_score() on X_final, y_final to validate stability.
Step 11:Plot Final Confusion Matrix
Visualize predictions of optimized model to see TP, TN, FP, FN.
